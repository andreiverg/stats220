#### ðŸ“Œ This is my repo for STATS 220.

#### A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in **computer science** and **statistics.** 
- I am taking STATS 220 because I find the idea that with enough data, we are able to make sense of the world around us.
- I am interested in learning about how I can achieve my goals and ambitions with both computer science and statistics.
